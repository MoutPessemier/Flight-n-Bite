# Flight-n-Bite
This app is made as a school project to learn the Windows platform. The task was to create an application that can be used on a plane flight.

As a passenger, you can watch movies, listen to music, order food, look up the weather of your destination and chat with your travel companions.

As a personnel member, you can message the passengers, handle their orders, change their seats and issue discounts on various products.
